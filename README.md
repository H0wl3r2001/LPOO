In this incredible platform game you can destroy waves of aliens with
your own ship. The objective is to get the higher score possible.

The player's ship can move to the sides and can go up and down within
a certain fixed range. The ship has 3 lives and can shoot "lasers".

The aliens are static and shoot downwards, randomly. Each alien has 1HP
which means that if the player shoots the alien, it will die instantly.

Asteroids move laterally and can only appear within the vertical range
of the ship. They show up at the 3rd wave.

The waves of aliens show up until the player as no more lives. Their
difficulty is increased as the game advances. This is done by adding
more aliens and by increasing the number of enemies that shoot
against the player.
